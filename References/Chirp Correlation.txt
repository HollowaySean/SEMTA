Sean,

At least one more task should be added to your list: signal correlation processing.

Iâ€™m going to replace the stretch processing waveform, which was not as good as I expected in Phase I test, with standard chirp modulation.

So, we need to have the chirp correlation processing algorithm.

Most likely, the best way for the correlation (convolution) algorithm implementation is applying FFT to both receive and reference signal, multiplying of the two FFT spectrums, and inverse FFT of the result.

Also, we need you to support some initial radar tests to verify and optimize the processing algorithm.

I agree with Alex that it would take more than 200 hours in total.

I will prepare SOW document for you after the SEMTA kick-off meeting (June 29th).
